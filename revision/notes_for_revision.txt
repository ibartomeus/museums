Things to fix during review:

REFERENCES: 

"However, bees are diverse, with more than 20,000 species currently described worldwide [@Archer2014]""
This ref is wrong: ref is Asher and pickering Discover life! -> Ascher, J. S. and J. Pickering. 2018.
Discover Life bee species guide and world checklist (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila).
http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?guide=Apoidea_species
**this paper is in the ref list

Add Pauw ref (now inserted manually). Also other evolutionary papers in the to do file can be added.-> Reconstruction of historical pollination rates reveals linked declines of pollinators and plants
A Pauw, JA Hawkins - Oikos, 2011
**added to refs list

Look for citation rarefied species confound evenness. ->  Gotelli, Nicholas J.; Colwell, Robert K. (22 July 2001). "Quantifying biodiversity: procedures and pitfalls in the measurement and comparison of species richness". Ecology Letters. 4 (4): 379â€“391. doi:10.1046/j.1461-0248.2001.00230.x.

Colour scale +/- and axes bigger font size.
**Have fixed this for fig 5. Perhaps try changing the colour palette to "topo" as per the richness change graphs? I can't get this chunk of script to run for some reason, so can't see if the change improves the map or not.
